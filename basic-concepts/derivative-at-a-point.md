# Derivative at a point

Generally speaking, if we know a value of a function at the point, it is impossible to find its derivative at the same point. But this becomes possible if we know some additional information about the function.

 Consider $$f(x) = x^2$$. 

At point $$x_0 = 3$$ we have $$f(x_0) = 9$$ and $$f'(x_0) = 2x|_{x_0} = 2x|_{3} = 6$$ .

What gives us an answer is an advanced knowledge of the symbolic derivative $$f'(x) = (x^2)' = 2x$$ .

If we know this rule, given an initial value $$x_0 = 3$$ and $$f(x_0) = 9$$ we are able to calculate the derivative. We even don't have to know the closed-form of $$f(x)$$ .
